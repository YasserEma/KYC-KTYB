# KYC Platform - Phase 2 Documentation

## Overview

Phase 2 of the KYC Platform introduces several key features to enhance the user experience and functionality of the application:

1. **Tenant-Branded Login Page**: A customized login experience that reflects each tenant's branding.
2. **Entities Page with BusinessTable Component**: A powerful, reusable table component with advanced features.
3. **Entity Details Drawer**: A sliding drawer that displays detailed entity information.
4. **CSV Export Functionality**: The ability to export filtered entity data with audit logging.

## New Components

### Tenant-Branded Login Page

The login page now dynamically loads and applies tenant branding information, including:
- Tenant logo
- Primary and secondary colors
- Custom styling based on tenant preferences

**Implementation Details:**
- Located at: `src/app/[locale]/auth/login/page.tsx`
- Uses Supabase to fetch tenant branding information based on the current hostname
- Dynamically applies branding styles to the login form

**Features:**
- Search functionality
- Column sorting (click column headers)
- Pagination with configurable page sizes
- Column visibility toggle
- Filtering by multiple criteria
- CSV export with audit logging
- "Create new" button with configurable path

**Implementation Details:**
- Located at: `src/components/ui/BusinessTable.tsx`
- Designed to be fully reusable across the application
- Maintains state in URL parameters for shareable links
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

### Entity Details Drawer

A sliding drawer component that displays detailed information about an entity:

**Features:**
- Tabbed interface for different information categories
- Streaming content sections for performance
- Screening history display
- Risk history display
- Documents section

**Implementation Details:**
- Located at: `src/app/[locale]/entities/EntityDetailsDrawer.tsx`
- Uses React's Suspense for streaming content
- Fetches data from Supabase based on the selected entity

### CSV Export Functionality

Allows users to export filtered entity data to CSV format:

**Features:**
- Exports current filtered view of entities
- Includes comprehensive entity information
- Automatically logs export actions to audit_logs
- Downloads as a properly formatted CSV file

**Implementation Details:**
- API endpoint: `src/app/api/entities/export/route.ts`
- Integrates with BusinessTable component
- Uses the same filters as the current table view

## Testing Instructions

### Tenant Branding

1. Access the application using different tenant domains
2. Verify that the login page displays the correct tenant logo and colors
3. Confirm that branding persists across login sessions

### Entities Table

1. Navigate to the `/entities` page
2. Test search functionality with partial entity names
3. Try sorting by different columns
4. Change page size and navigate between pages
5. Toggle column visibility
6. Apply filters and verify results
7. Click on rows to open the details drawer

### CSV Export

1. Apply desired filters to the entities table
2. Click the "Export CSV" button
3. Verify the downloaded file contains the correct data
4. Check audit logs to confirm the export was recorded

## Key Decisions

### URL-Based State Management

We chose to store table state (sorting, filtering, pagination) in URL parameters to enable:
- Shareable links with preserved views
- Browser history navigation
- Persistence across page refreshes

### Component Reusability

The BusinessTable component was designed to be highly reusable:
- Generic typing for different data structures
- Configurable columns and features
- Separation of UI and data fetching concerns

### Performance Optimizations

Several optimizations were implemented:
- Server components for initial data loading
- Client components for interactive elements
- Suspense boundaries for streaming content
- Efficient data fetching with pagination

### Security Considerations

Security was prioritized throughout:
- Tenant isolation in all queries
- Proper authentication checks
- Audit logging for sensitive actions
- Input validation and sanitization

## Phase 2.5: User Sign-Up

### Sign-Up Flow

The application now includes a complete user sign-up flow that allows new users to register with tenant-specific accounts:

**Features:**
- Tenant-branded sign-up page matching login page styling
- Automatic tenant association based on domain
- Default role assignment (ANALYST)
- Email verification requirement
- Success feedback with redirection to login

**Implementation Details:**
- Located at: `src/app/[locale]/auth/signup/page.tsx`
- Uses Supabase Auth for user creation
- Creates entries in:
  - `profiles` table for user information
  - `user_tenants` table for tenant association with ANALYST role
- Logs sign-up attempts to audit_logs

### Testing the Sign-Up Flow

1. Navigate to the `/auth/signup` page on a tenant domain (e.g., acme.localhost:3000)
2. Complete the sign-up form with display name, email, and password
3. Verify the success message appears
4. Check email for verification link (in a production environment)
5. Verify the user can log in after email verification
6. Confirm the user has the ANALYST role and is associated with the correct tenant

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future phases:
- Advanced filtering capabilities
- Bulk actions on selected rows
- Customizable dashboard views
- Real-time updates using Supabase subscriptions
- Enhanced mobile experience
- Role-based permissions system
- Self-service password reset
